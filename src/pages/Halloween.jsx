            Each October, there's little more I look forward to than pumpking
            carving night. A still young tradition with my bud and I (and
            potential guests), one Saturday night turns into great BBQ, rock and
            metal music, a few adult sodas and pumpkin carving. Since we're
            starting to build a little resume for ourselves, and garnishing
            interest from family and friends, I decided to share some of our
            work here. Hope you enjoy! Cheers

            Anakin Skywalker was a powerful and brilliant Jedi Knight, but his
            emotional nature, fear of loss, and growing mistrust of the Jedi
            Council made him vulnerable to the influence of Emperor Palpatine
            (Darth Sidious). This, along with a disfiguring battle loss to
            Obi-Wan Kenobi, led to the birth of the uber villain, Darth Vader.

            Owls are masters of the night, possessing unique physical traits
            that make them incredibly efficient predators. Their wings are
            equipped with specialized feathers—a stiff leading edge, a soft,
            fringed trailing edge, and a velvety surface—which muffle the sound
            of air rushing over the wing, allowing them to approach prey in
            near-silence.

            of the original band in 1975, Furnier legally changed his name to
            Alice Cooper and launched a solo career with the concept album

            When R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) uses a flamethrower to burn the
            creature, Norris's head violently tears itself away from the burning
            body, landing on the floor. The severed head then rapidly sprouts
            several thin, insect-like spider legs and attempts to scurry away
            across the floor. This transformation is what prompts the famous
            line, "You gotta be f***ing kidding!" from the character Palmer.

            the ability to live on and kill in the dreams of the children in
            exchange for his soul. Freddy accepted, becoming a powerful Dream
            Demon seeking revenge on the children of the parents who killed him.

            Irving's story, which was published in 1820, the Headless Horseman
            is said to be the ghost of a "Hessian trooper" (a German mercenary
            soldier hired by the British) who was decapitated by a cannonball
            during an unnamed battle of the American Revolutionary War near
            Sleepy Hollow, New York.

            A scarecrow is a decoy, typically a mannequin in the shape of a
            human, placed in an open field or garden to deter birds, such as
            crows and sparrows, from eating seeds and damaging growing crops. It
            is one of the oldest forms of agricultural pest control. It's
            aesthetics and timing with the traditional final harvest time is
            likely why it's been a successful association with Halloween.
